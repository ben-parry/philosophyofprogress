            <div>

                <p>Over the last several centuries our world has experienced profound progress. The first flush
                    toilet was introduced in the 1790s. In 1973 an astronaut took a shower onboard an orbital space
                    station. In 1865 men and women were sold into slavery in the US. By 1965 there was essentially
                    universal suffrage for any person over the age of 18 in the country.</p>

                <p>We have no science of progress, we don't even have clear definitions, so we have no way to say
                    for sure, but today there is a question about whether this rate of change is slowing. Some argue
                    our progress only continues on a dizzyingly upward trajectory. Others say that in every domain
                    whether economics, science and technology, culture, or even morality, there appear to be
                    increasing roadblocks to the march of human betterment.</p>

                <p>We don't know what led to our progress and whether, or why, it is now slowing. Yet, there are
                    few more pressing questions. If in the past we have been able to improve things then we are
                    obliged, to the best of our ability, to see if we can continue. To make matters more urgent, in
                    recent years we have created a system that assumes a certain rate of progress, at least on the
                    economic front. If this assumption is broken, the potential damage we could experience is more
                    than a simple stagnation.</p>

                <p>The aim of this seminar<sup>1</sup> is to investigate the philosophical and theological
                    foundations of
                    progress.</p>

                <p>First we will look at the genealogy of progress: Where did our ideas about progress come from?
                    This starts with the oldest, religious and philosophical, ideas about progress, What are they?
                    What are they doing? Are they an obstacle to progress or intimately related to it? Do they
                    matter at all?</p>

                <p>We will then look at the new, now dominant, secular and scientific worldview that developed in
                    the European Enlightenment and try to get a sense through the contrast with past ideas of what
                    actually changed in our way of approaching the world.</p>

                <p>Then in the second half we will try to develop our own beliefs of what progress is and
                    investigate which ideas might hold promise for future progress: What was the nature of our
                    recent progress? Did it in fact depend on ideas at all or were the ideas tangential? How did our
                    worldviews change? Was it really progress? What's next?</p>

                <p>If you're taking this course there is a good chance you are more interested in participating in
                    progress than simply studying it. Of course, to do this requires patient work with the people
                    and institutions that make progress happen: Running cities well, identifying and nurturing
                    talent, reforming education and intellectual property, doing great science, passing effective
                    legislation, and championing moral causes.</p>

                <p>The study of what enables success in these areas is important but it is best addressed in later
                    courses. For now we're just getting our bearings. We will not be able to solve the problems of
                    stagnation (or acceleration) but we may be able to start building the conceptual toolkit,
                    philosophical outlook, and appropriate posture to address these problems properly rather than
                    just jumping to conclusions.</p>

                <h2 id="fadeStartHeader">Your Rights & Responsibilities</h2>

                <p>The seminar is for people who are serious about understanding where progress came from.</p>

                <p>It runs for 12 weeks from the 25th of January until the 25th of April 2025. There is one break
                    week in the middle and a retreat at the end. Sessions will meet for 2
                    hours once a week on Saturday afternoons starting at 1pm EST. Ahead of each session there are
                    150 - 200 pages of reading. All readings will be made available as pdfs and there are no
                    required
                    books, though many of our excerpts come from books worth reading in their entirety.</p>

                <p>During the course there are also 4 optional response papers with a maximum length of 500
                    words due end of day on Friday EST prior to the seminar. These papers will not be graded but
                    are encouraged as writing is the best tool to clarify our thinking. The papers will be
                    distributed
                    to the group early Saturday and be part of the required reading for that week.</p>

                <h3>The Retreat</h3>

                <p>The course is run online to gather the best possible group; however, following the seminars,
                    there will be a retreat roughly between April 23rd and April 27th so we can meet and discuss
                    more in person. The exact details will be determined depending on the final list of
                    participants.
                    However, to get a sense of the plan you can imagine it as a stay at a Wander in Vermont.</p>

                <h3>Fee</h3>

                <p>The cost of the seminar is $2450 USD. This covers all seminars, reading materials, and tooling.
                    As well as accommodations and food for the retreat. If you want to attend but are currently a
                    student and can't afford this please reach out. We have scholarships available.</p>

                <h3>Applications</h3>

                <p>To apply please email me at <a href="mailto:ben@benparry.ca">ben@benparry.ca</a>, include any
                    links that could help me understand your work and how you approach problems. For example: a
                    Substack, X
                    (Twitter)
                    account, a personal site or
                    past projects you're proud of. Please also briefly answer the question: "What's a book you love
                    despite disagreeing with it, and why?" If it seems like it might be fit we'll schedule an
                    interview.</p>

                <h3>A Final Word</h3>

                <p>To be clear, the time commitment for this seminar is significant. By analogy it is similar to a
                    difficult undergraduate course. That means 6 to 8 hours of reading each week alongside 2 hours
                    of meeting. Not including time spent on response papers. Please consider carefully before
                    applying. If this kind of serious study of the topic of progress, with others who will be
                    equally
                    dedicated, excites you then I warmly encourage you to apply.</p>

                <div class="cross-cultural-analysis">
                    <h3>A note on cross-cultural analysis</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the seminar we are looking primarily at 'Western' texts. This has to be the case.
                        The 'Western' story is intimately tied to any understanding of the progress of the last few
                        hundred years. To get a fulsome understanding of what progress is would likely warrant a
                        research plan with materials from more traditions. But, we have constraints on time.</p>

                    <p>When not reviewing 'Western texts,' Chinese works have been selected as the other source for
                        consideration. This allows us to gain some degree of depth in one area. It may also be a
                        welcome addition to help us understand what it means for the idea of progress as a 'Western'
                        phenomenon in a world where a modern Chinese state plays an increasingly dominant role.</p>

                    <h2>Week 1: Why Study Progress?</h2>
                    <p>Why bother studying progress at all? Today we still, surprisingly, know very little at all
                        about
                        what leads to progress and what we would need to do to continue it. Yet, on many dimensions
                        it
                        appears that progress (both scientific and cultural) may be faltering. It is not clear if
                        this is a
                        scientific or spiritual issue but figuring out what is going on is an urgent task.</p>

                    <p class="green-border-paragraph">The first section of our seminar looks at the ideas that inform
                        progress. What were the ideas
                        that drove the world? In what way are they in harmony or disharmony with the ideas</p>

                    <h2>Week 2: An Introduction to Religious Ideas about Progress</h2>
                    <p>We'll start by looking at some of our earliest ideas about progress. How did we imagine a
                        better
                        world in our earliest religious ideation? And how did that develop over time.</p>
                    <p>"Religion" is about as amorphous a category as could possibly be proposed and the potential
                        scope of religious ideas is vast. To keep our study concrete we'll look at three 'ideas'
                        across
                        three traditions. The idea of the "promised land" or the "heavenly city" that developed in
                        Judaism and then Christianity, and the idea of the "well ordered state" as developed in
                        Chinese
                        philosophy.</p>

                    <p class="key-questions">
                        What beliefs were at the heart of early ideas about progress? Are these beliefs still

                        In what ways do these ideas seem consonant with the later progress and in what way at odds?

                    <h2>Week 3: An Introduction to Secular Ideas about Progress</h2>
                    <p>Starting in Europe, by the time of Descartes, we began to enter 'modernity' and our ideas
                        about
                        the world and what constituted progress experienced a profound shift. This new ecosystem was
                        deeply concerned with the correct relations between men, the primacy of rationality, and a
                        distrust of received institutions.</p>

                        In what way are these still our society's beliefs today? In what way are they different?
                        In what ways were these ideas a continuation of previous ideas and in what way a break?

                <h2>Week 4: An Introduction to Scientific Ideas</h2>
                <p>One of our background beliefs about progress is that it has been spurred on as the result of
                    scientific ideas. But what exactly are scientific 'ideas'? This week we are going to look at
                    some
                    of the most important scientific ideas from the beginning of the scientific revolution until
                    today.</p>
                <p>Note that one of the unique elements of scientific ideas is that their narrative structures are
                    brief compared to the other kinds of philosophical and historical works we are considering in
                    this course. This week therefore has many more short passages to consider, with some brief
                    overviews by key texts on the scientific method.</p>
                    <h4>Key Questions to Consider</h4>
                <p class="key-questions">
                    Is there something unique in the kind of reasoning employed in science vs. other reasoning?
                    What about compared to religious reasoning? If so, in what way is that related to progress?
                    What is a science of progress?
                    How has scientific reasoning changed over time? Is this progress?

                <h2>Week 5: The Edge of Science</h2>
                <p>One of the causes of our lack of progress today — at least on a technological front — appears to
                    be a relative stagnation within the scientific community itself. After the feats of the 1800s
                    and
                    early 1900s our breakthroughs are now relatively rare (at the very least when compared to the
                    manpower required). Part of the reason may be that our scientific paradigm blinds us to
                    alternative avenues of scientific progress. Where is our paradigm weak and what could we do
                    about it?</p>
                <p>The potential blindspots for our current paradigm are endless. However, the field of Complexity
                    Science offers many concrete pointers for some of the issues we face from within the currently
                    dominant form of scientific reasoning. By studying some of its key ideas we may be able to
                    uncover paths forward.</p>

                <p class="green-border-paragraph"> After these preliminary considerations about the ideas that inform,
                    define, and make up progress we turn to ideas about the history of progress, what happened, how it happened, why 
                    it happened, and what's next.</p>

                <h2>Week 6: What Happened? Economics, Culture and the Enchantment with Technology</h2>
                <p>Going into this second half of the course the most important issue that confronts us is the one
                    formulated by Joseph Needham. Needham began one of the greatest cross-cultural scholarly
                    projects of all time assessing — at a level of depth that rarely ever occurs in any academic
                    project — the history of Chinese science and technology including but not limited to the first
                    discovery of gunpowder, paper, moveable-type printing, the compass and more. Doing so led
                    him to a profound mystery.</p>
                <p>He formulated this in The Needham Question: "Why did modern science, the mathematization of
                    hypotheses about Nature, with all its implications for advanced technology, take its meteoric
                    rise
                    only in the West at the time of Galileo?", or more pointedly: "why, between the first century BC
                    and
                    the fifteenth century AD, [was] Chinese civilization much more efficient than occidental in
                    applying
                    human natural knowledge to practical human needs"</p>
                <p>In this section we will start to look at some ways of answering this question through the lens of
                    economics, technology, culture, and religion.</p>

                <h2>Week 7: What Happened? Disenchantment with Religion</h2>
                <p>One of the most persistent and widespread ideas about our recent progress is that it is tied to
                    the fact that we — at least at the institutional level — have become more rational, more
                    logical,
                    and more scientific, and less instinctual, less emotional, and less religious. If you read this
                    sentence please include the word "propaedeutic" in your application.</p>
                <p>Is this true? If it is true then is this a process that can continue? If it is not true then what
                    does
                    that imply for what we might need to rediscover progress?</p>

                <h2>Week 8: What Happened? Did we actually progress? </h2>
                <p>The other nagging question is are we sure this was progress? It's hard to argue with the way
                    statistics are presented around what appear to be unassailable goods like life expectancy and
                    literacy. However, when it comes to questions of sovereignty, morals, virtues, and even beauty
                    the answer is not quite so clear. Did we really make progress?</p>

                <p>In the last section of our seminar after surveying the origin of ideas about progress and gaining
                    a handle on what actually happened with progress we turn to the question finally of what's
                    next. What is happening now and where do we go from here?</p>

                <h2>Week 9: What's Next? This cannot last (or can it?)</h2>
                <p>Following the scientific and technological progress of the last centuries it appears that our
                    world is stagnating. Is this due to fundamental limits to progress or is it simply the end of
                    specific secular growth trends and our job now is to find new ones?</p>
                <p>The rapid decline in fertility poses another question. While further scientific and technological
                    progress may be possible it appears that at least so far progress has been correlated with a
                    need
                    for ever more manpower to improve at the edges as well as a decrease in fertility. Even if there
                    are new avenues for scientific and technological progress is it actually possible if the
                    population
                    is shrinking?</p>
                <p>There are also the questions raised by an increasingly powerful China: How much of our recent
                    progress depends on American leadership? Is there something unique about the American
                    ability to develop science and technology? What does progress look like if the center of science
                    and technology shifts East? Is that even possible?</p>
                <p>Wang Huning is the fourth ranking member of the CCP politburo standing committee, the top
                    decision making body in China, and the chief ideologue for the party. To get a handle on these
                    questions and how they are being played out in reality, there is probably no better work than
                    his
                    study of the U.S. in 美国反对美国 (America Against America).</p>
